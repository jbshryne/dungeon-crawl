# Dungeon Crawl Game

For my capstone project, I'd like to work on a "boardgame" that I've had in mind since I first began coding. The game is a Dungeon Crawler, where the player is a hero who must navigate a dungeon and defeat monsters to win. The game will be played on a 2D grid, and the player will be able to move around the grid, attacking enemies (and hopefully gaining powerups).

I have many "stretch goals" to make this my ultimate version of the game -- like multiplayer coop and a map editor -- but for this project, I'll focus on the core gameplay and basic game mechanics. To help with this, and as the requisite "new tech" for the project, I'll be utilizing a library called [boardgame.io](https://boardgame.io/). Ideally, this will allow me to focus on the unique features of the game and not have to worry about the game engine. (As a fallback, I'll learn & use Redux to manage the game state.)
